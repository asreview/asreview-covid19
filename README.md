Extension to add publications on COVID-19 to [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview).

# ASReview against COVID-19 (Deprecated)

## This extension is deprecated. It still works for version 0.x of ASReview but datasets are no longer updated.

The Active learning for Systematic Reviews software [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) implements learning algorithms that interactively query the researcher during the title and abstract reading phase of a systematic search. This way of interactive training is known as active learning. ASReview offers support for classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art learning algorithms like neural networks. The software can be used for traditional systematic reviews for which the user uploads a dataset of papers, or one can make use of the built-in datasets.

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team released an extension that integrates the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19 in the ASReview software. Experts can **start reviewing the latest scientific literature on COVID-19 immediately!** See [datasets](#datasets) for an overview of the datasets (daily updates).


## Installation, update, and usage

The COVID-19 plug-in requires ASReview 0.9.4 or higher. Install ASReview by following the instructions in [Installation of ASReview](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Install the extension with pip:

```bash
pip install asreview-covid19
```

The datasets are immediately available after starting ASReview (`asreview oracle`). The datasets are selectable in Step 2 of the project initialization. For more information on the usage of ASReview, please have a look at the [Quick Tour](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quicktour.html).

Older versions of the plugin are no longer supported by ASReview>=0.9.4. Please update the plugin with: 

```bash
pip install --upgrade asreview-covid19
```


## Datasets

The following datasets are available:

- [CORD-19 dataset](#cord-19-dataset)
- [COVID19 preprints dataset](#covid19-preprints-dataset)

:exclamation: The datasets are checked for updates every couple of hours such that the latest collections are available in the ASReview COVID19 plugin and ASReview software.

[![ASReview CORD19 datasets](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/docs/images/asreview-covid19-screenshot.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-covid19)

### CORD-19 dataset
The [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is a dataset with scientific publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from PubMed Central, the WHO COVID-19 database of publications, the preprint servers bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv, and papers contributed by specific publishers (currently Elsevier). The dataset is compiled and maintained by a collaboration of the Allen Institute for AI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, and the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. The full dataset contains metadata of more than **100K publications** on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. **The CORD-19 dataset receives daily updates and is directly available in the ASReview software.** The most recent versions of the dataset can be found here: https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases.html

### COVID19 preprints dataset
The [COVID19 preprints dataset](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints) is created by [Nicholas Fraser](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser) and [Bianca Kramer](https://github.com/bmkramer), by collecting metadata of COVID19-related preprints from over 15 preprint servers with DOIs registered with Crossref or DataCite, and from arXiv. The dataset contains metadata of >10K preprints on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. All versions are archived on [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12033672). The COVID19 preprints dataset receives weekly updates.

The most recent version of the dataset can be found here:[https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv).
