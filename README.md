Extension to add publications on COVID-19 to [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview).

# ASReview against COVID-19
The Active learning for Systematic Reviews software [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) implements learning algorithms that interactively query the researcher during the title and abstract reading phase of a systematic search. This way of interactive training is known as active learning. ASReview offers support for classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art learning algorithms like neural networks. The software can be used for traditional systematic reviews for which the user uploads a dataset of papers, or one can make use of the built-in datasets. 

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team released an extension that integrates the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19 in the ASReview software.

## CORD-19 dataset
The [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is a dataset with scientific publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from PubMed Central, the WHO COVID-19 database of publications, the preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv and papers contributed by specific publishers (currently Elsevier). The dataset is compiled and maintained by a collaboration of the Allen Institute for AI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, and the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. Version 6 of the dataset ([csv](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020-04-03/metadata.csv), dated April 3, 2020) contains metadata of 47.3K publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. The CORD-19 dataset is updated weekly. 

## ASReview plugin

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team has decided to release a package that provides the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19. These are integrated automatically into ASReview once we install the correct packages, so reviewers can start reviewing the latest scientific literature on COVID-19 as soon as possible!
Two versions of the CORD-19 dataset (publications relating to COVID-19) are made available in ASReview: 

- full CORD-19 dataset
- CORD-19 dataset with publications from December 2019 onwards

The current datasets are based on **CORD-19 version 6 (released 2020-04-03)**

The datasets are updated in ASReview plugin shortly after the release by the Allen Institute for AI. 

## Installation and usage

The COVID-19 plug-in requires ASReview 0.8 or higher. Install ASReview by following the instructions in [Installation of ASReview](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 

Install the extension with pip:

```bash
pip install asreview-covid19
```

The datasets are immediately available after starting ASReview. 

```bash
asreview oracle
```

The datasets are selectable in Step 2 of the project initialization. For more information on the usage of ASReview, please have a look at the [Quick Tour](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quicktour.html).
