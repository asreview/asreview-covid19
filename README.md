Extension to add publications on COVID-19 to [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview).

# ASReview against COVID-19
The Active learning for Systematic Reviews software [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) implements learning algorithms that interactively query the researcher during the title and abstract reading phase of a systematic search. This way of interactive training is known as active learning. ASReview offers support for classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art learning algorithms like neural networks. The software can be used for traditional systematic reviews for which the user uploads a dataset of papers, or one can make use of the built-in datasets. 

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team released an extension that integrates the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19 in the ASReview software.

## CORD-19 dataset
The [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) is a dataset with scientific publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from PubMed Central, the WHO COVID-19 database of publications, the preprint servers bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv, and papers contributed by specific publishers (currently Elsevier). The dataset is compiled and maintained by a collaboration of the Allen Institute for AI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, and the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. The full dataset contains metadata of >60K publications on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. The CORD-19 dataset is updated weekly.

The most recent version of the dataset can be downloaded here:  
[https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/metadata.csv](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/metadata.csv).  
Older versions are archived on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715505).

## COVID19 preprints dataset
The [COVID19 preprints dataset](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints) is created by [Nicholas Fraser](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser) and [Bianca Kramer](https://github.com/bmkramer), by collecting metadata of COVID19-related preprints from over 15 preprint servers with DOIs registered with Crossref or DataCite, and from arXiv. The dataset contains metadata of >8K preprints on COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research. The COVID19 preprints dataset is updated weekly.

The most recent version of the dataset can be downloaded here (csv):  
[https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv).  
All versions are archived on [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12033672)

## ASReview plugin

To help combat the COVID-19 crisis, the ASReview team has decided to release a package that provides the latest scientific datasets on COVID-19. These are integrated automatically into ASReview once we install the correct packages, so reviewers can start reviewing the latest scientific literature on COVID-19 as soon as possible!
Two versions of the CORD-19 dataset (publications relating to COVID-19) are made available in ASReview, as well as the COVID19 preprints dataset

- full CORD-19 dataset
- CORD-19 dataset with publications from December 2019 onwards
- COVID19 preprints dataset

The current datasets are based on **CORD-19 version 11 (released 2020-05-12)** and **COVID19 preprints version 7 (released 2020-05-10)**

The datasets are updated in ASReview plugin shortly after their release. 

## Installation and usage

The COVID-19 plug-in requires ASReview 0.8 or higher. Install ASReview by following the instructions in [Installation of ASReview](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 

Install the extension with pip:

```bash
pip install asreview-covid19
```

The datasets are immediately available after starting ASReview. 

```bash
asreview oracle
```

The datasets are selectable in Step 2 of the project initialization. For more information on the usage of ASReview, please have a look at the [Quick Tour](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quicktour.html).
