# R-scripts for processing COVID 19 preprints dataset

## The COVID19 preprints dataset

The [COVID19 preprints dataset](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints) is created by Nicholas Fraser and Bianca Kramer, by collecting metadata of COVID19-related preprints with DOIs registered with Crossref or DataCite, and from arXiv. 

The most recent version of the dataset can be downloaded here (csv):  
[https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/covid19_preprints/blob/master/data/covid19_preprints.csv).  
All versions are archived on [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12033672). 

Version 5 of the dataset (dated April 26, 2020) contains metadata of 6.3K preprints related to COVID-19 from > 15 preprint servers.
